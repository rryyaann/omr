   <h1>The Language Dream Team</h1>
   <h4>I'm Ryan, the founder of Language Dream. The concept for Language Dream was born from a problem I had. I was living in Seoul, South Korea and I was frustrated at having to teach a Korean friend English for 1 hour for every hour I wanted to practice speaking Korean. As much as I loved teaching English, I wanted to focus on learning Korean. And I had an idea on how to make that happen.</h4> 
   <h4>I couldn't find anything like it on the web, so I had to build it myself. For the longest time, this was just a dream.</h4> 
   <h4>Language Dream is the never final product of 3+ years of slowly learning how to build a website and getting an MBA at UCLA to learn how to scale a sustainable company.</h4>
   <h4>Feel free to drop me a line, or visit the Language Dream world headquarters at the University of California, Los Angeles.</h4>
